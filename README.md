To Add (5:19PM on 10/26/22)
- Allignment
- max width (form)
- Post Results Button
    - append somethig to the dom 
    - Change the DOM in some way (for example, refresh the page and show the quiz results).
        - Have a button on that page that says "Take another quiz" that takes you back to the quiz page
    - Put a Check âˆš or x next to the input field box when it's right or wrong
- Create an image for the header
    - stylize the header (put in a div container?)
- Messages window . Make it so the submit button sends a message only if it contains something. That message gets appended
to a div container to the right of the form. This DIV container is scrollable, and the messages appear like reviews on a yelp page
with a time/date stamp, the user(name from form) who submitted the message, and the message itself
- Let's make better questions.
- Let's put instructions on the website, telling the user about the "spaces" restriction onkeydown, and how using plural
will confuse the quiz taking.
- Submit form - make the POST submit form change color when hovered over, change color when clicked, and change back when keyup(or whatever it is)
