# GETTING TO KNOW THE COHORT!!!

 In this project our idea was to learn more about the ***Amazing*** peaople in our  ***Wonderful*** cohort!! All there is to it is a QnA about your self that will get submitted to our quiz generator 



## *How it Works*

---

1. When the page is loaded it displays a form with questions about you lovely individuals.

2. Once the user has filled out the question, clicking the "submit" button will place the form data into our own API. 

3. After the website has graciously thanked you for your submissions, feel free to generate a quiz with a random selection of questions about your classmates. BUT, before that, please leave us a message on our message board! (once you start your quiz, the message board will no longer be accessible.

4. Once you **attempt** to answer all the questions, 'POST' your results using the button below. After an alert displays your score, our UI will color-code your answers based on their truthines--i mean, their correctness.

5. Stay tuned for some upcoming features we're working on for version 2, 3, and 4, of the Flatiron Cohort Quiz!

6. There is an easter egg--though it should be called an easter cat-- hidden in our project. Chett, if you see your cats anywhere, could you let us know?
